# Folder: /lib/aceternity-ui/docs

This directory contains files related to the documentation setup and installation guides for the Svelte Aceternity UI library.

## Contents

-   **`allinstallations.ts`**: This TypeScript file defines the structure and content for various installation guides presented on the documentation website. It exports the `allInstallations` array, which likely contains objects detailing the steps for setting up SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, and other project utilities required or recommended for using the Aceternity UI components. Each object typically includes a title, description, and a series of code blocks with instructions.

This folder focuses on the **"how-to"** aspects of getting started with the library and setting up the necessary environment, rather than containing the UI components themselves.
