# Folder: /lib/aceternity-ui/web

This folder contains Svelte components and utilities specifically designed for the web presentation layer of the Svelte Animations documentation site.

Currently, it includes:
- **AceternitySidebar.svelte**: A responsive sidebar navigation component used for the documentation site layout. It handles both mobile and desktop views and dynamically generates navigation links based on a provided structure.

Unlike general-purpose UI components found in the main `/lib/aceternity-ui/components/` directory, items in this folder are typically tailored for the structure and needs of the documentation website itself.
